JuveFood
========

Sailfish application. Fetches menus from any Juvenes restaurant.

You can get the .rpm from here: [http://relativity.fi/JuveFood/](http://relativity.fi/JuveFood/)

Icon by fercen.

Notes
=====

This is alpha version, so there's some missing features (and bugs):

- Opening hours are not yet implemented
- Restaurants may be in different order after every update because the data is pushed to UI asynchronously
- only current day's foods are shown
- language option translates only foods, nothing else (if there are both translations at Juvenes API)
- loader icon is missing if network connection is slow
- Settings UI is not so great
- Current date does not update if the app is running, only restart updates it

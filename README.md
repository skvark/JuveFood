JuveFood
========

Sailfish application. Fetches menus from any Juvenes restaurant.


Notes
=====

This is alpha version, so there's some missing features.

- Opening hours are not yet implemented
- Restaurants may be in different order after every update because the data is pushed to UI asynchronously
- only current day's foods are shown
